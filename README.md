Repository for term project of Experimental Seminar: Computational Modeling

## DataPreprocessing and Modification
** These files are unnecessary to run, csv files are processed datasets. Just for informing the preprocessing methods **
Preprocessing includes changing the mat file to csv files.
Modifcation includes normalization and labeling process for each variable.

## Modeling
Each .ipynb file contains models below
Modeling.ipynb: original model
Modeling_additive.ipynb: subjective original model
Modeling2_phatppe.ipynb: phatppe model
Modeling2_mixed.ipynb: subjective mixed model

Codes include MLE, individual bayesian and hierarchical bayesian. 

## Data simulation and parameter recovery analysis
To run DataSimulation file, files containing estimated parameters should be included in /outputs folder. 
Also, for RecoveryAnalysis file, original and simulated parameter information csv file should be included in the same folder
